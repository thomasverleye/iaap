# WAS
WAS is short for _Web Accessibility Specialist_, a certificate provided by _International Association of Accessibility Professionals_ ([IAAP](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/)).

In this folder I'll document my progress into studying for my WAS exam. I will be mainly following the [Deque University WAS Preparation](https://dequeuniversity.com/member) and write down summaries in markdown files in this repository.

## TOC
1. [Accessibility Fundamentals - Disabilities, Guidelines, and Laws](./1-accessibility-fundamentals-disabilities-guidelines-and-laws.md)

## Legend
üó£Ô∏è is basically a prefix to show I try to summarize this part of knowledge in my own words.
