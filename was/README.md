# WAS
WAS is short for _Web Accessibility Specialist_, a certificate provided by _International Association of Accessibility Professionals_ ([IAAP](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/)).

In this folder I'll document my progress into studying for my WAS exam. I will be mainly following the [Deque University WAS Preparation](https://dequeuniversity.com/member) and write down summaries in markdown files in this repository.
