## Blindness

### Description
Blindness is generally characterized as sightlessness or a loss of vision. While the term “blindness” is often used to define a total loss of vision, it may also refer to partial blindness, where sight may be extremely limited.

They use screenreaders to use software, read content and browse the web.

### Challenges & Solutions for people with Blindness

#### `[ICT]` Cannot see digital or electronic interfaces
- Screen readers can read interfaces and content out loud to users by converting digital text to synthesized speech.
- Self-voicing interfaces and applications can communicate to users.
- Refreshable braille output devices use screen readers to convert digital text to braille.

#### `[ICT]` Cannot use screen readers on digital content and interfaces
- Interface designers and content authors can edit the markup to make it compatible with the assistive technologies.

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` Cannot see when walking
- Canes help blind people feel their surroundings as they walk.
- Service animals help them navigate their surroundings.
- GPS-based walking instructions with an audio interface.
- Raised tiles on the ground to indicate the edge of a platform.
- Eliminate low-hanging architectural features that a blind person could bump into.
- Clear pathways without obstructions in hallways, sidewalks.

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` Cannot see signs or other text
- Map and geolocation applications on mobile devices can announce related information.
- Braille labels and descriptions can allow to explore and understand their surroundings.
- Tactile models of the exterior form a mental map of their surroundings.

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot see or feel the controls on flat interfaces on devices (eg. dishwashers)
- Alternative interfaces with knobs or other tactile controls
- Audio interfaces
- Remote control through applications on mobile devices

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot read the text on the containers or packaging
- Embossed braille (or braille stickers) on packaging and product containers help consumers identify items

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot read money to determine its value
- Applications on mobile devices can photograph the money and read the value to blind people.
- Paper bills and coins could be manufactured in different sizes, shapes, or textures to allow blind people to distinguish the value based on touch.
- Non-cash systems of payment can allow blind people to make financial transactions via a device with screen readers or self-voicing output.

#### `[CONSUMER]` Cannot read print
- Optical character recognition software can convert scanned images of text into digital text readable by screen readers.
- Information can be placed online or in other digital formats to be read using their own assistive technologies.

## Low Vision
People with low vision can see, but their vision is still quite far from perfect even with powerful corrective lenses. Those who have low vision may be unable to see well enough to drive or read most printed text unless they enlarge it. Low vision isn't a single condition.

As they have different conditions they will also use different assitive technologies to use digital devices:
- Screen magnification (to enlarge small text);
- Screen readers (helpfull for them to hear the text as well);
- Color Customization (for better contrast or to avoid bright white light)

### Challenges & Solutions for people with Low Vision

#### `[GENERAL]` Small text can be hard to read
- Screen magnifiers can enlarge the items on the screen to make them easier to read.
- Utilities to enhance contrast, change colors, or alter other aspects of visual appearance can improve legibility.
- Screen readers can supplement screen magnifiers by reading interfaces and content out loud to users through synthesized speech.
- Self-voicing interfaces (eg ATMs) and applications can communicate to users without the need for a screen reader.
- Alternative large print versions of small print text can make printed materials easier to read.
- Alternative digital versions of printed materials can give users the ability to read the materials using their own assistive technologies.

#### `[GENERAL]` Low contrast text can be hard to read
- Software or hardware options can enhance the contrast of digital text.
- Interface designers and content creators can choose color combinations with high enough contrast to easily read.

## Color Blindness
Color-blindness does not literally mean that a person can't see any color at all (except in very rare cases). Color-blindness refers to the inability to distinguish between certain kinds of colors, especially colors that are of equal brightness or luminosity, even if the colors themselves appear quite different to people without color-blindness.

Common solution for people with color blindness: **do not use ONLY color for information**.

### Types of Color Blindness
There are several types of color blindness and it's a spectrum in how they may vary so it's quite hard to sum up which are the worst.

- **red-green color-blindness** (Common sub types: Deuteranopia and Protanopia);
- **blue-yellow color-blindness** (Rare sub type: Tritanopia);
- **grayscale color-blindness** (Very rare sub type: Achromatopsia);
- **red-Black color-blindness** (no name or subtype)

### Challenges & Solutions for people with color blindness

#### `[GENERAL]` Certain color combinations can be difficult to distinguish
- Materials can be designed in a way that does not depend on color as a way to convey information.

## Deafblindness

### Description
For a descriptions of both disabilities see [Blindness](#blindness) and [Auditory Disabilities](#auditory-disabilities).

Their only option in assitive technologies is **braille**. They mainly going to use the refreshable braille display in combination with a screen reader.

### Challenges & Solutions for people with deafblindness

#### `[ICT]` Digital text cannot be seen
- A screen reader can convert text to braille on a refreshable braille device, or "printed" in a braille embosser.

#### `[ICT]` Audio & Video cannot be heard nor seen
- A text transcript of the audio can be converted to refreshable braille by a screen reader, or "printed" in a braille embosser.

## Auditory Disabilities
There are several types of Auditory Disabilities:
- Hearing impairment;
- Hearing loss;
- Deafness;

Hearing impairment or hearing loss have diminished hearing and may have difficulty understanding speech and distinguishing foreground noise from background noise.  
Some of them depend on **hearing aid or lip reading**.

For people with total loss they depend on **sign language or communication board**.

Causes of this disabilities varies, it may include genetics, premature birth, infections/illnesses, ear trauma, exposure to loud noises, aging, ...

deaf and Deaf (see capitalization) mean different things. Deaf with a capital refers to the Deaf community & culture. Deafness is not viewed as a loss by those in the Deaf community.

### Challenges & Solutions for people with Auditroy disabilities

#### `[ICT]` The audio or audio portion of videos cannot be heard
- Provide synchronized captions with videos
- Provide sign language interpretation

#### `[GENERAL]` Speeches and talks cannot be heard by deaf people in the room
- Provide sign language interpretation

## Mobility, Flexibility, and Body Structure Disabilities

### Description
Mobility disabilities affect a person’s ability to move independently and purposely.

Some examples are people who have missing limbs, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, stroke, partial or complete paralysis, or arthritis may experience limitations with moving their body or parts of their body.

Causes for these disabilities may vary, they can be present from birth, occur due to aging, or be the result of a disease. And they can be temporary, permanent or periodically recur or relapse.

The **abilities and characteritics may vary** because this is a broad category.

### Challenges & Solutions for people with Mobility, Flexibility, and Body Structure Disabilities

## Cognitive Disabilities

### Description
It is a very large spectrum which is hard to define as a whole but there are a few categories:
- **Limited Comprehension** Some people don't understand complex ideas, have it difficult with methaphors or abstract language. Some may have great cognitive functioning in one area (remembering conversations) but have lower functioning in others (emotional awareness, ...).
- **Low Tolerance for Cognitive Overload** too much input may cause some people to freeze or become frustrated. They need things to be simple and straightforward with not to many choices.
- **Limited Problem-Solving Skills** Some people might not be able to solve problems and may even not attempt it. (for instance a captcha).
- **Short Term Memory Loss** some people may lack the memory doing things in between one moment and the next.
- **Attention Deficit** making it hard for them to focus on the task at hand, they may get lost in their own thoughts.

Causes for these disabilities may vary, birth, development conditions at young age, traumatic injury, infections, chemical imbalance, ...

## Speech Disabilities

### Description
Speech disabilities are characterized by the inability to produce or organize speech sounds and syllables correctly or with fluency.  

Some speech disabilities may be genetic, while other causes of speech disability may include learning disabilities, auditory disabilities, Autism spectrum disorder, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and cancer (oral or laryngeal).

### Types of Speech Disabilities
- **Stuttering** is a speech disability that affects the fluency of speech sounds. 
- **Cluttering** consists of rapid speech that may be inconsistent in rhythm and lack syntax, or grammar.
- **Apraxia** is a motor speech disability that occurs when a person has difficulty using muscles for speech production to form sounds of words.
- **Dysarthria** is a motor speech disability that occurs due to brain damage. The muscles for speech production are impaired causing slurring speech or hoarse sounding.
- **Speech sound disorders** are disorders where certain sounds of speech may be difficult to produce, specifically consonant sounds. Two main categories: *Articulation disorders* and *Phonemic disorders*.
- **Muteness (mutism)** is the complete inability to produce a speaking voice.

### Communication Options
AAC = Augmentative and Alternative Communication. Basically alternative ways to communicate.
- **Unaided AAC** is based on non verbal communication without external tools (eg. body language, facial expressions, gestures and sign language).
- **Aided AAC** rely on the use of an electronic or non-electronic tool and the person's body. Tools can range communication books and boards, to pen and paper, to electronic devices that produce computer-generated voices.

### Challenges & Solutions for people with Speech Disabilities

#### `[ICT]` May be unable to communicate with voice-based technology tools like virtual meetings

- Provide captions and transcripts for video and audio materials
- Check that digital content is keyboard accessible
- Present information in multiple formats to assist with information processing

#### `[ARCHITECTURE]` May be a wheelchair user, or may have difficulty using hands or arms
- Same solutions for motor disabilities

#### `[GENERAL]` Difficulty with producing speech sounds
- May use low tech AAC such as communication boards or gestures to supplement speech
- May use high tech AAC such computer-generated voices to replace speech
- Be patient and give people time to communicate thoughts; Ask for clarification, if necessary

## Seizure disorders

### description
Seizures are abnormal or erratic electrical impulses in the brain that interfere with a person's ability to process information or, in some cases, control voluntary muscle movement.

They can be triggered through various impulses, in digital accesibility we'll focus on flashing lights. Putting flashing or strobe-type effects in videos, graphics, or animations can put some viewers at risk for seizures. Seizures caused by flashing lights are sometimes known as **photo-epileptic seizures**.

It's important to note that not all seizure disorders are happening because of flashing lights.

### Challenges & Solutions for people with seizure disorders

#### `[ICT & GENERAL]` Sensitivity to flashing lights, blinking, and flickering stimuli
- Avoid creating animations, videos, and other graphics, that have flashing or strobe-like effects whenever possible.
- If flashing content must be used, flashing should not occur more than 3 times per second.
- Tools that may be helpful are flicker-free monitors, monitor glare guards, and non-glare glasses.

## Psychological/Psychiatric Disabilities

### Description
Psychological, or psychiatric disabilities, encompass a vast range of emotional and mental conditions. These conditions are first diagnosed as **"mental illness"**. When the mental illness disorder **impacts daily major life** activities, it then becomes a **disability**.

Causes vary, they may be from birth, genetical, trauma, chemical imbalance or social factors.  
The types of psychological disabilities we will discuss in the section are: anxiety disorders, mood disorders, schizophrenia, and some other disorders.

### Anxiety Disorders
People with anxiety disorders persistently fear or worry about certain situations or objects.
- **Panic Disorder** is anxiety disorder that causes feelings of terror and impending doom.
- **Phobias** are strong, excessive, paralyzing fears of particular objects or situations. (eg. claustrophobia)
- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD**, is an anxiety disorder that may occur after a person has been exposed to a terrifying or traumatic event.
- **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder** is an anxiety disorder where a person has perpetually upsetting, distressing thoughts called obsessions.

### Mood disorders
Also known as affective disorders or depressive disorders, cause erratic changes in a person's mood. 
- **Depression** is characterized as a brain disorder. People who have depression may experience prolonged sadness, loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities, worthless feelings, or suicidal thoughts.
- **Bipolar Disorder** is a mood disorder that consists of cycling periods of feeling mania, or highs and happy feelings; and depression, or low, sad feelings.
- **Seasonal Affective Disorder**, or SAD, is a mood disorder that affects individuals during the fall and winter months. During these months, people with SAD experience depression possibly due to shortened daylight. Depression tends to lift during the spring and summer months.

### Schizophrenia 
This is an extremely complex disorder. The causes of schizophrenia are unknown, but theories suggest that genetics and biology may be factors. Experiences with this disorder are generally categorized into two groups: "positive" and "negative."
- **Positive** hallucinations and hearing things;
- **Negative** lack of motivation, a dreary mood, and isolating oneself from society.

### Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
This is a behavioral disorder where a person has difficulty focusing, paying attention, and controlling his or her behavior. The person may also be hyperactive.  
Experiences with ADHD are divided into three subcategories: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.
- **Inattention** — difficult focussing and processing new info;
- **Hyperactivity** - restlessness and continuously talking
- **Impulsivity** - difficult controlling emotions, interupt conversations, activities, or conversations.

### Personality Disorders
- **Antisocial Personality Disorder** is a personality disorder where a person exhibits a pattern of behavior that shows no regard for the rights of others and violates the rights of others. 
- **Borderline Personality Disorder** is a personality disorder where a person experiences long-term instability in mood, behaviors, relationships and self-image. 

### Eating Disorders
- **Anorexia nervosa** is an eating disorder that causes a person to eat very little food and keep weight an at unhealthy low.
- **Bulimia nervosa** is an eating disorder where a person eats a lot of food and then purges the food.
- **Compulsive, or binge, eating** is an eating disorder characterized by eating a much larger amount of food in a shorter period of time than the amount that would normally be eaten.
