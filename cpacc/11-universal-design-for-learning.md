## Definition
Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is an approach to designing curricula that eliminates barriers in the learning environment in order to improve educational experiences for all learners.

## The Science Behind Learning

### The Three Primary Brain Networks
Research in neuroscience has discovered that three primary brain networks play a role in gathering new information and being engaged in education.

#### Recognition Networks

Recognition networks enable us to collect knowledge (eg. Perceiving and gathering information, understanding ideas, recalling facts, and recognizing voices and language).

#### Strategic Networks

Strategic networks are involved when learners apply the knowledge they have acquired (eg. planning and organizing tasks, connecting ideas together, executing actions and demonstrating skills).

#### Affective Networks

Through affective networks, learners are engaged in the learning process. Affective networks in the brain enable us to assign significant or personal meaning to newly acquired knowledge and discover what stimulates us during the learning process.

### No One Thinks Exactly the Same
With knowing how learning takes place through these neural networks, not everyone is going to perceive information exactly the same way. Not everyone is going to connect ideas in the same manner or assign the same meaning or significance to a piece of knowledge.

## Principle 1: Provide Multiple Means of Representation
Focuses on ensuring **variety in instructional delivery so all students recognition networks get activated**. Consider those who may have cognitive, visual, and auditory disabilities, or those who may speak a different native language.

### Guideline 1: Provide Options for Perception
- Allow Information to be Customized
- Make Auditory Information Accessible
- Make Visual Information Accessible

### Guideline 2: Provide Options for Language, Mathematical Expressions, and Symbols
- Explain Vocabulary and Symbols
- Highlight Syntax and Structure
- Decipher Mathematical Notation, Text, and Symbols
- Support Other Languages
- Utilize Multiple Media Formats

### Guideline 3: Provide Options for Comprehension
- Provide Background Knowledge
- Focus on Patterns, Critical Features, Big Ideas and Relationships
- Support Information Processing, Visualization, and Manipulation
- Support Transfer and Generalization

## Principle 2: Multiple Means of Action and Expression
Learners are also diverse in ways they demonstrate knowledge and skills.

### Guideline 4: Provide Options for Physical Action
- Provide Options for Response and Navigation
- Support Tools and Assistive Technologies

### Guideline 5: Provide Options for Expression and Communication
- Utilize Various Media for Communication
- Provide Options for Construction and Composition
- Support Fluency through Practice and Performance

### Guideline 6: Provide Options for Executive Functions
- Encourage Student Goal-Setting
- Support planning & strategy
- Support information and resource managment
- Allow for Progress Monitoring

## Principle 3: Multiple Means of Engagement
Recognize the need for providing multiple ways to get learners involved in their education.

### Guideline 7: Provide Options for Recruiting Interest
- Promote Individual Choice and Autonomy
- Emphasize Relevance, Value, and Authenticity
- Reduce Threats and Distractions

### Guideline 8: Provide Options for Sustaining Effort and Persistence
- Reiterate Goals and Objectives
- Vary Learning Challenges
- Promote Collaboration and Communication
- Give Mastery-Oriented Feedback Often

### Guideline 9: Provide Options for Self-Regulation
- Use Belief to Increase Motivation
- Help Strengthen Coping Skills and Strategies
- Nurture Self-Assessment and Reflection
