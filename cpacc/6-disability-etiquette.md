| Playing "guess who" games with people who are blind or visually impaired | Introduce yourself by name to a person who is blind |
| Speaking to the friend or support worker of a person with a disability | when the conversation is directed at the person with a disability | Speak directly to the person who has the disability |

## Helping People with Disabilities
**Don't Assume People with Disabilities Need Help**, ask the person with a disability if they need any assistance.
They may be trying out techniques, if you help a person without permission could startle them and throw them off.

**Offer Help When it is Truly Needed**, sometimes, situations go without saying. (eg. a blind person drops something).

**Say "Hello"** and ask how they are doing, as a neutral question. If they don't ask for any help this probably don't need any help.

## Service Animals
**Don't pet, feed, play, distract service animals.** They may become less controllable which might become a problem and dangerous in some cases.

Sidenote, just don't pet animals you don't know at all. Always ask a owner first if they can pet their animal. They can have issues and react in a less friendly as you may expect.

## Assistive Technologies
**Never touch, lean on, or pick up a person's assistive device.** It's part of the personal space of the person.

## Everyone Is Different
The ettiquettes discussed are the "preferred" but everyone has their own interpretation. Some people interpret "handicapped" offensive, other don't bother the term.

**When in doubt, ask the person.**
