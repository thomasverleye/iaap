## Defining Usability
Usability determines how easy a designâ€™s user interface is to use and how functional a product or design is. Key components of usability assess:
- How easy it is for users to learn the basic tasks of the interface;
- If users can perform those tasks quickly;
- If users can recall performing those tasks after time away from the interface;
- The number of errors, the severity of errors, and recovery from errors in the interface; and
- If the design satisfies users.

## Commonalities
The components used for evaluating usability can also be applied to accessibility. Accessibility focuses on how usable and satisfying a product or service is to people with disabilities, including but not limited to people who use assistive technologies. In terms of usability, accessibility increases the chances of more people being able to use a product or design regardless of their abilities.

Some examples:
- Creating a higher contrast not only provides the ability to users with low vision but also to users that use an application in bright sun.
- Making a website that is more keyboard accessible benefits for non disabled users too who prefer to use their keyboard.
- Usability practices that promote using simple language and intuitive designs may assist those with cognitive disabilities.

## Differences
- Usability issues tend to affect every user, both users with disabilities and users without disabilities;
- Accessibility issues occur when people with disabilities encounter difficulties using or accessing a product or service.
