# [Basic Disability Concepts](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/iaap-cpacc/basic-concepts/)
## Our Diverse Abilities

Roughly **20% (1 in  5 people)** have some kind of disability. They can divided in different types:
- Recognizable Disabilities (eg. blindness, paralysis, loss of limbs, ...)
- Hidden Disabilities (eg. deafness, reading disorders, seizures, neurodiverse)
- Temporary Disabilities (eg. broken bone, burnt limbs)
- Age-Related Disabilities (eg. loss of sight, hearing, mobility & cognitivity)

### Disabilities on the Web
Not all disabilities have impact in using the web, the disabilities with the most effect are disabilities in the eyes, ears, hands, and brain.

## Accessibility Matters
**Print disabilities** is another term for discribing an effect of the blindness. They aren't able to read traditional print communication, which we have a lot in our world if you start to look around.

There are several ways for blind people to read a traditional newspapers but they all have flaws:
- They can ask a family member, but then this family member needs to be available (they could become sick or can be busy);
- People could record it for blind people, but then they are dependant if those people read out the story the blind people are interested in;
- An emboser could create a braille copy, but this is expensive and not every blind person can read braille;
- Radio & television stations can bring out similar reports, but those reports could be less in-depth then the newspaper article.

In comes the digital revolution with the **screen readers**... When speech synthesizers were invented, it allowed blind people to listen to text read out loud by computers and allowing them to navigate through the web **independantly**.

As you read now, the web has enabled a disabled person with blindness very impactfully as they don't have to depend on others to gain a great source of information.

**BUT**... only if the content is Accessible!  
Unfortunantly, not all content is optimized for screenreaders nor for other people with disabilities. The potential is here but not all resources are created with accessibility in mind.

## Assistive Technologies
In the **real world**, there are several objects and technologies to assist a person with disabilities:
- A wheelchairs;
- Crutches;
- Hearing aid;
- Canes;
- Glasses or contact lenses;

In the **digital world** you also have several technologies to assist:
- Screen readers;
- Braille devices;
- Screen enlargers;
- Color enhancers;
- Captions & transcripts;
- Head wand or mouth stick;
- Alternative keyboards;
- Eye gaze tracking;
- Voice recognition;

We need to keep in mind that these digital technologies **don't completely compensate** for the disability. They are similar to the real world assistive technologies, just like a wheelchair enables a person to go places they wouldn't be able without, but there are constrains in built environment that limit their effect.  
**An assistive technology is just as effective as the environment the person it is trying to use it in, the organization creating the environment has the responsibility to make it accessible for everyone.**

## The Digital Accessibility Revolution
Back with the wheelchair comparison, there is a term called "wheelchair-bound", which is a contradictory term as the wheelchair is not bounding the person but enabling the person.  
The same can be said about the web, the web is a part of the solution, not the source of the problem.

Web developers learning about Accessibilty for the first time will think backwards and see the web as part of the problem, but in reality **the web is an important part of the solution**.

Think of the first example where people with blindness didn't have the ability to read a newspaper but with the revolution of the web they had a whole other way to have access to information.

Another example of this could be a person with quadriplegia (paralysis) that wants to go shopping. Without the web they would need to depend on a lot of external help to go to a shopping mall:
- They need basic help for personal hygiene;
- If no public transport is available, they will need someone driving them;
- Once in the mall you might run into some barriers in terms of accesibility but also into finding the right help in the shops themselves;
- They also need to get back home as well;

Since online webshops, these people won't need to go through this hassle.
