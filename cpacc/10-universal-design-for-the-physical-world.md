## Universal Design Principles

### Background
In 1997, a group of architects led by Ronald Mace at North Carolina State University called into question approaches to designing buildings, products, and environments.

Together, the architects concluded that physical spaces and products should be "universal".

### The Seven Principles of Universal Design
The group of architects developed seven principles to guide those working in the field in universal design.

#### Principle One: Equitable Use
The product or environment should be useful and marketable to everyone.

#### Principle Two: Flexibility in Use
A variety of options for use of its features, should be adaptable to an individual's preferences and abilities.

#### Principle Three: Simple and Intuitive Use
Features should be easy to understand, the person their background or abilities should not hinder their understanding of how to use those features.

#### Principle Four: Perceptible Information
Communicate effectively and should be perceivable to everyone and presented in different formats to increase effective communication to individuals with diverse abilities.

#### Principle Five: Tolerance for Error
Reduce the chances of accidents or hazards from occurring and anticipate any unintentional actions that may occur during use.

#### Principle Six: Low Physical Effort
Require little to no physical effort to use so no person would be feeling fatigued during use or after use.

#### Principle Seven: Size and Space for Approach and Use
Sufficient space should be provided so that it allows anyone to use the features regardless of physical build or physical abilities.
