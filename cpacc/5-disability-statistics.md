# [Disability statistics](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/iaap-cpacc/disability-statistics/)

> [!NOTE]
> **Learning Goals of this Section**  
> The CPACC will test on your ability to demonstrate an understanding of the data trends and implications of disability demographics and statistics.
> You need to address and answer the data in:
> - Regions / parts of the world;
> - Types and age groups;
> - Issues between datasets of countries;
> - Relationship between aging and disabilities;
> - Relationship between unemployment and disabilities;
> - Relationship between poverty and disabilities;
> - The consequences of those relationships;
> - Relationship between smoking, obesitas, diabetes, heart diseases with disabilities;
> - Formulate reasons for those trends;

## Incidence and Prevalence
Estimates for the percentage of people with a disability range from about 10% to 20%, **depending on the survey methodology, definition of the word "disability," and other factors**.


This means that in a random group of 10 people worldwide, 1 or 2 of those people are likely to have a disability. That's a minority, but it's a rather **sizable minority**. Of the approximately 7 billion people on the planet, about 700 million to 1.4 billion have disabilities.

We are also all **susceptible** to disabilities. An able-bodied person can acquire a disability through an illness or an accident.

## Why Disability Statistics Are So Variable

### Differences in How "Disability" is Defined
Narrow definitions will result in smaller percentages of people reporting a disability. Broader definitions will result in larger percentages.

### Differences in Data Collection Methods
- The strategy of the survey can cause a wide variance in results:
  - Some surveys rely on individuals to report their own disabilities;
  - Others rely on observations or data collection activities by the people administering the survey;
- The purpose of the data collection is can be important as well:
  - If the person is eligible for government benefits;
  - If the answer result in negative consequences or social stigma;
- The wording of the questions on a survey also matters:
  - Vague wording of questions like "Do you have a disability?";
  - Specific questions will get more meaningful answers.

### Political or Public Relations Biases
Country organizations may be reluctant to report accurate numbers as it may look bad on their situation. (Countries unsupportive of gay rights sometimes do forge their numbers in gay poppulation, keeping that in mind what makes them report accurate numbers in people with disabilaties?).

### Comparing Statistics Across Countries
For all above reasons is hard to compare data accros countries. It's evenly hard to compare same country data from different types of surveys.

## Aging Populations
Older people are more likely to have disabilities. (30% - 60%)  
Reason is that it's part of the aging process: Lose of sight, hearing, mobility and/or cognition is more likely to devolve.  
Combinations often happen which makes it even more important to involve this population group.

**Countries with large aging populations will have more disabilities.** (Poverty and war may have an impact on this data and tip the scale more to younger people with disabilities).

Looking into the future **digital savvy adults are aging and might become disabled** meaning that the market of **accessible digital technologies is expected to increase**.

## Education Levels & Literacy
People with disabilities tend to be less educated than the general population.  
This has several causes:
- In severe disabilities, traditional education through the school system is impossible.
- The education system may not be able to handle students with disabilities.
- There are other barriers that reduce the availability and/or quality of education.

Consequences are people with disabilities may be **less qualified** to get a job in comparison to more educated abled people. Leading to  **vicious cycle of poverty**.

## Employment Rate

### Disabilities (and Workplace Discrimination) are Linked to Unemployment
People with disabilities as a group tend to be disproportionately represented among unemployed.  
Workplace discrimination and inaccessible work environments often reduce the employment opportunities for people with disabilities.

## Poverty and Disability

### Disabilities are Expensive
It goes without saying that disability can be expensive.
- People who need a electrical wheelchair (2k - 30k) and might need assistance;
- Support systems (assistive technologies plus human helpers) varies dramatically depending on the type of disability;

### Disabilities Can Be Both the Cause and the Result of Poverty
Large proportion of people with disabilities, and their families, live in or near poverty, especially in poorer countries.

In the US, people with disabilities are twice more likely to live in poverty.
