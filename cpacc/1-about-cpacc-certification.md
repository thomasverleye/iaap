# [About CPACC Certification](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/iaap-cpacc/about-certification/)
## Why Certify
It's kind of obvious but it may be interesting to get some motivation why you would get certified for CPACC.

### Benefits for People with Disabilities
In the Deque University course this benefit is set as the last one in the list, seemed a bit silly so I add it first here:

**The real goal is to make the world more accessible to people with disabilities. Certification moves us closer to that ultimate goal.**


### Benefits for Individuals Who Certify
Passing the exam means that you have a certain level of expertise, you could say:
- It's a way to **prove to yourself & others** that you are a professional in the field.
- You will have a certification that you can **show in your resume**, standing out in job applications.

### Benefits for Organizations that Encourage Certification
- **Employees get motivated** to learn more about accessibility and incorporate it into their skillset.
- Having talented people who can do accesibility right will improve the **trustability** to their clients.

### Benefits for the Accessibility Profession
- The more people get certified, the more **the industry will see accessibility as a legitimit expertise** and not as a "side project".
- The more legitimit the **more full-time jobs get created**.
- It also **set the bar** of what it means to be an accessibility professional.

## Who Should Certify?
Anyone can certify, the CPACC credential is for designers and developers in any field that creates any kind of user experience (physical or virtual), plus the managers who coordinate the design process.
