## The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it declares rights that everyone in the world should have.

## UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
This convention is the most important political and democratic expression of the will to grant and guarantee equal human rights to people with disabilities at a global level.

### Background & History
In 2008 the **Optional Protocol** was launched, which implements the competencies and rights of the Committee on **the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to monitor and accept complaints**. 

### Impact of the UN CRPD
With its Optional Protocol it provides a powerful tool for monitoring and claiming for equal rights. It has become a key instrument for people with disabilities to fight discrimination and exclusion and to promote, implement, monitor and defend inclusion, accessibility and equal opportunities.

It covers 50 articles obligations of governments to guarantee the rights of people with disabilities of a wide range (Communication, Healtcare, Housing, Assistive Technologies, Support independent living, Mobility, Participation in different social activities, Facilitating monitoring)

### Digital Accessibility and the UN CRPD
ICT, AT, accessibility and universal design make the UN CRPD operational and its implementation reasonable at a very practical level.

### Referring to and Using the UN CRPD
The UN CRPD is a high-level instrument for political and legislative activities in the disability movement. It is one of the most powerful arguments we have at hand.

## The Marrakesh Treaty
The full name of this treaty (adopted on June 27, 2013) is The Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled.

This treaty seeks to ensure that people with vision or other print disabilities can access published materials such as books. 

## Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union

## Civil Rights Laws

## Procurement Laws
Procurement refers to the process of government entities purchasing goods and services from external sources. There are laws and rules in place, though, that regulate government procurement to ensure that money is spent wisely and to prevent fraud and waste from occurring.

### United States — Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
requires the U.S. federal government to take accessibility into account when procuring information technologies.  
In January 2017, a significant change is that the WCAG level A and AA guidelines are now incorporated by reference and required.

### Europe

#### EN 301 549: "Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services"
is a voluntary harmonized European standard with a broad set of requirements, originally created to provide accessibility requirements for all ICT products and services.  
This standard has been set up to create equal European procurement requirements in terms of accessibility.

Parts of EN 301 549 relating to the web refer to WCAG 2.1 level AA. It is in line with the expectation that EN 301 549 will also become the applicable standard for the private sector.

#### EU Directive 2016/2102
applies to the public sector and has already transpired. Websites, intranets, and extranets had to comply as of September 23, 2020. For mobile apps, the date was June 23, 2021. Directive 2016/2102 refers directly to the European standard EN 301 549.

Directive 2016/2102 does not require procuring accessible solutions, but the websites and apps must be accessible when they are made available to the users.  
Requirements include the following:
- Websites and applications must be accessible;
- an accessibility statement must be provided;
- there must be a method for users to report accessibility issues;
- and a link to enforcement procedures must be provided.

#### EU Directive 2019/882
For the private sector, EU Directive 2019/882 applies. Various sectors are mentioned by name, including e-commerce, banking, e-books, and electronics. This standard must be transposed into national law by June 28, 2022. This legislation must then be applied from June 28, 2025. Directive 2019/882 does not directly refer to the European standard EN 301 549.

#### European Accessibility Act (EAA)
The main goal of this Act is to create a common set of accessibility guidelines for EU member states and fix the diverging accessibility requirements.  
The EU member states have had two years to translate the act into their national laws and have four years to apply them (enforcement to commence in 2025).

The EAA will use standards that already exist (like EN 301 549 and other for environmental) and new ones (For non-ict products, for help desk services, emergency call center).

Per the EAA, non-government organizations, the responsible national authority, or other bodies are permitted to go to court on behalf of a person under national law. It also permits penalties for failure to comply with accessibility standards. EU member states are each responsible for enforcing the act.
