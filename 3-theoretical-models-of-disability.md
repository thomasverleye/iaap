## Medical Model
The medical model is the definition of the disability in terms of biological impairments. It's viewed as a problem, caused by a medical diagnose (eg. genetics, diseases, trauma, ...).

_The condition is the "problem"._

The legal definition of a disability is often relying on the medical modal. Often governmental grants are relying on these defenitions (eg. when an employer has to provide accomodations for a employee, or a university should provide help for a student).

### Strengths of the Medical Model
What seems stating the obvious for a person with a disability about their condition, but this is one of the only ways to get the correct treatment via medical professionals, or receiving governmental assistance.

### Weaknesses of the Medical Model
1. The model focusses on the **biology of the person**, while ignoring the fundamental issues of the designers who make something inaccesible for the people with a certain medical condition.
2. The model **labels and stigmatizes** a person as different and _less than_ the rest of the population. This has a psychological impact.
3. People who don't fit in the definition are not seen as **worthy** of certain benefits. It has a **danger to be too narrow** for some people with disabilities.
4. Individuals need to prove their disability through this, this extra level of bureaucracy **is time consuming and can be dehumanizing**.


## Social Model
The social model is the direct response on the medical model. It points out that **society creates disabling environments**, caused by poor design.

_Disabling environments are the problem._

The social model does not deny the medical model, it only points out that inclusive design can enable people. The social model emphasizes on **the human rights** of people with disabilities to participate in life in meaningful ways.

It gives a **meaningful context for acccesibility professionals** to provide an environment that is enabling instead of disable people.

### Strengths of the Social Model
First and foremost, the model **removes the stigma and empowers** the people. It gives them the view that they can expect that society creates inclusive environments and their quality of life has to be different from people without these disabilities.

It gives the **designers** of the environment **the empowerment to think broadly** about usability for all humans. Making an environment more usable is **often better for everyone**, not just disabled people.

### Weaknesses of the Social Model
Sometimes, despite the positive impact, the social model can de-emphasize the reality of a disability too much. Ones disability can be an important part of their identity, accepting their disability can be healthy emotionaly and pshycholigically.

## Biopsychosocial Model
This is multifaceted model that incorporates the mecical and social modal. It's the **basis of the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) which is a publication by the WHO** in 2002.

## Economic Model
The Economic model views disabilities impact on individuals, employers, state & welfare programs.

It recognizes impact on the ability to work and it various implications (eg. people might earn less and have a more expensive way of living, employers could have smaller profit margins, the state might need to increase the cost in welfare)

The impact is similar to what we saw on the medical model.

## Functional Solutions Model
This model rather has a practical view on disabilities. It does not look as much to the other models but focusses on applying innovation to overcome these limitations.

Often businesses that create and sell accessibility solutions often take this approach. They focus on specific needs of people with certain disabilities (eg. people who cannot use their hands may need help to cut food, open a door, ...) 

Accessibility professionals are interested in these functional solutions as this is their job. Some of them are intereseted in the socio-political impact, some aren't.

### Strengths of the Functional Solutions Model
This model focuses on creating results in benifits for people with disabilities. It emphasises on **getting things done**.

### Weaknesses of the Functional Solutions Model
Not looking at the social/political picture might make that a certain solution be obsolete when one would adress the larger social context.

## Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model
Some people with disabilities may develop a sense of culture and identify themselves with their disability. Sometimes groups create a culture on their shared experience.

### Deaf Culture and Identity
Deaf people for instance have a whole language on their own, because hearing people often don't know sign language the deaf people spend time with each other. There is even a deaf theater!

### Strengths of the Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model
- Self-Acceptance and Empowerment - this has an impact on emotional strength and support by others who know what they are going through.
- Political Strength - Forming alliances to gain advocacy and a voice is easier in a group.

### Weaknesses of the Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model
The social identity model doesn't always serve as a useful basis for technical definitions of disability. 

It can be also isolating from society if you identify yourself with only a small group of other people.

## Charity or Tragedy Model
This model sets people with disabilities as unfortunate and tragic. People without disabilities take pity and setup fundraisers etc to improve the condition of the people with disabilities.

It is received as offensive, as the attitude and the assumptions are a form of unequal power balance between the the people with and without disabilities.

### Strengths of the Charity Model
This model can create a sense of empathy in those without disabilities and inspire them to genuinely assist people with disabilities.

### Weakness of the Charity Model
As previously mentioned, the charity or tragedy model encourages unequal social and political relationships between people, which can actually slow down progress for people with disabilities as a whole.

## Other Models

### Affirmation Model
Similar to Social & Cultural model is that people are encourage to affirm their identity being disabled and feel comfortable in their skin.

### Sociopolitical Model
The sociopolitical model is more of an activist model that emphasizes the need for human rights for people with disabilities.

### Religious/Moral Model
One interpretation of the religious/moral model assumes that disabilities are given to people as a punishment for actions of either the individual herself or of her parents or others who have brought this condition upon her.

### Expert or Professional Model
The expert or professional model is a variation of the medical model, in which disabilities are meant to be treated and managed by people with expertise and credentials.

### Rehabilitation Model
The rehabilitation model is also a variation of the medical model, with an emphasis on therapy or rehabilitation for the person with a disability to improve the person's ability to function and compensate for the disability.
