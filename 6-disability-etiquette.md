| Speaking to the friend or support worker of a person with a disability | when the conversation is directed at the person with a disability | Speak directly to the person who has the disability |

## Helping People with Disabilities
**Don't Assume People with Disabilities Need Help**, ask the person with a disability if they need any assistance.
They may be trying out techniques, if you help a person without permission could startle them and throw them off.

**Offer Help When it is Truly Needed**, sometimes, situations go without saying. (eg. a blind person drops something).

**Say "Hello"** and ask how they are doing, as a neutral question. If they don't ask for any help this probably don't need any help.

## Service Animals
Don't pet, feed, play, distract service animals. They may become less controllable which might become a problem and dangerous in some cases.

Sidenote, just don't pet animals you don't know at all. Always ask a owner first if they can pet their animal. They can have issues and react in a less friendly as you may expect.
